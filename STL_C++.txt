
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

STL has four components

Algorithms
Containers
Functions
Iterators



Templates in C++
A template is a simple and yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for different data types.
