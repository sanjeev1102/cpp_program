E.g

  1.       Write a macro to extract the data from a 32 bit integer which has two 8 bit int value and one 16 bit int value. Candidate answered with bitwise operator (<< and >>).

 2.       There are 1000 bulbs connected in a board in series connection and one of them is not working. How do you find them? Engineer answered with binary search algorithm to find it,  divide 1000 to some small segment such as 50 nodes at once and then do sequential search with these 50 running in a loop.
