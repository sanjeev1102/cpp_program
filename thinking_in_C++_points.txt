The hidden implementation
It is helpful to break up the playing field into class creators (those
who create new data types) and client programmers4 (the class
consumers who use the data types in their applications). The goal of
the client programmer is to collect a toolbox full of classes to use for
rapid application development. The goal of the class creator is to
build a class that exposes only what’s necessary to the client
programmer and keeps everything else hidden. Why? Because if it’s
hidden, the client programmer can’t use it, which means that the
class creator can change the hidden portion at will without worrying
about the impact to anyone else. The hidden portions usually
represent the tender insides of an object that could easily be
corrupted by a careless or uninformed client programmer, so hiding
the implementation reduces program bugs. The concept of
implementation hiding cannot be overemphasized.
